# Twilio Podcast Dial In
 A dial in service for podcasts from RSS using Twilio

 Using Twilio and [rss-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rss-parser) based on a [Dial a Sermon](https://www.brightec.co.uk/blog/podcasting-to-those-without-internet-access) code I created a dial in service for [SeforimChatter](seforimchatter.com) to allow listeners to listen to the latest episodes using a dial in number.
